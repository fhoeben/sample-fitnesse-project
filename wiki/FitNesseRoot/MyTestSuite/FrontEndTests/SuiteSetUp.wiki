Help: Defines where to look for fixture code, and ensures browser is started.
---
This set up page is executed once, before any tests in this suite.
In it we configure which Java packages contain the logic for our fixtures, which browser we want to use for Selenium tests and we start this browser.
This means we do not have to do this in every test, which means easier maintenance and better performance.

Stopping the browser is done in SuiteTearDown, which is done after all tests in this suite are completed.
