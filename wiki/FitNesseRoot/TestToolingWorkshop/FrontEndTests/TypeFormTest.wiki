In this test we will fill in a form and afterwards check that our responses have been properly recorded.
To ensure we check the right results we will use a random name, which we will later use to filter the response from this test run from all responses received.

We define a random name, and comment.

|$myName=   |value of|!randomString (5)      |
|$myComment=|value of|More !randomString (10)|
